# Cook Scheduler

Welcome to Two Sigma's Cook Scheduler!
In this repository, you'll find several subprojects, each of which has its own documentation.

. `scheduler` - This is the actual Mesos framework, Cook. It comes with a JSON REST API.
. `jobclient` - This is the Java API for Cook, which uses the REST API under the hood.
. `spark` - This contains the patch to Spark to enable Cook as a backend.
. `datomic-migration` - This tool allows you to clean old data from your Cook database. This tool should be run every 6-9 months to keep Cook fast.
. `agent` - This contains an example enhanced Mesos executor for Cook which supports progress updates and heartbeats.

Please visit the `scheduler` subproject first to get started.
