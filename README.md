# Cook Scheduler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/Cook.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/Cook)

Welcome to Two Sigma's Cook Scheduler!

You'd probably like to run Spark jobs on Cook, right?
First, go to the `scheduler` subproject, and follow the README to build and launch the Cook scheduler Mesos framework.
Then, go to the `spark` subproject, and follow the README to patch Spark to support Cook as a scheduler.
If you'd like to learn more or do something different, read on...

## Subproject Summary

In this repository, you'll find several subprojects, each of which has its own documentation.

* `scheduler` - This is the actual Mesos framework, Cook. It comes with a JSON REST API.
* `jobclient` - This is the Java API for Cook, which uses the REST API under the hood.
* `spark` - This contains the patch to Spark to enable Cook as a backend.

Please visit the `scheduler` subproject first to get started.
