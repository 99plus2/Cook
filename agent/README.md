# Cook Agent

The Cook agent is an example of how to write a Mesos executor that integrates more closely with Cook.
It is currently not ready for production; please file an issue with any questions!

## Building

To build the application, use `lein release-jar`.
There's currently no way to run it, until the appropriate hooks are added back to the scheduler.
